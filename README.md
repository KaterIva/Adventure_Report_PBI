### AdventureWorks Report
consists of visuals, that represent different findings 
and insights from the dataset. 

It is based on data from CSV tables: `AW_Calendar_ Lookup`, 
`AW_Customer_Lookup`, `AW_Product_Categories_Lookup`, `AW_Product_Lookup`, 
`AW_Product_Subcategories_Lookup`, `AW_Returns`, `AW_Sales_2015-2017`, `AW_Territiries_Lookup`.
There were also added a range of calculated columns and measures, created with DAX functions.

The tables are related to one another (relation one-to-many `1:*`). Please check
